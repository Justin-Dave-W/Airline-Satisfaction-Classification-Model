#  Predicting Customer Satisfaction in Airline Industry


## General Overview
**Goal:**
- Create a classification model capable of predicting customer satisfaction in the form of a binary categorical variable (satisfied/not satisfied)
- Identify prominent factors from the model that affects customer satisfaction classification

**Data Source:**
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data
- Shape = 129,880 rows and 24 columns
- Variable Examples: Flight distance, customer rating from 0 to 5 on wifi and online booking services, age, departure delay in minutes

**Models Tested:**
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

**Model Optimization Methodologies:**
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearch
- Cost Complexity Pruning
- Wrapper Method Feature Selection
- Binning Contineous Variables
